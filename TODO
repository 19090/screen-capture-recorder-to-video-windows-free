log stats to the registry on exit... [+ jruby can read them to display...]

can use hwnd.
  re-check stats when using versus not.
  does this work when thence dragged too...?
  
can "force only next frame" ness? might not need this...
  skip_frame_if_same_as_previous option :P yes

dropdowns for selecting an audio [?]
  and encoding
  maybe fps :P

audio: instructions "just use your mic" or "pipe a bit of your mic back through line in, and use line in/virtual-audio-capturer"
  or allow it to have several channels for now...sure :P
    and eventually umm...fix ffmpeg to allow for it?

remember directory

minimize to tray

mouse drawing is the A+ wrong way LOL
  window resize with button seems much better overall

include the audio grabber too

actually use it. playon competitor? LOL
  auto skype recorder :)
  can use the default record device in...XP

can "record" not just play from desktop or vice versa
  oh and stream LOL
  
gstreamer for streaming?

compensate:
  [libx264 @ 03BD9100] width or height not divisible by 2 (403x417)

== speedup ==

  it defaults to 24 bits [maybe wrongly?]

  can I live with aero wasn't bitblt getting like 800fps *with* aero?
  threading the input [?] (a bit complicated because of the "only if it's changed" mantra)
    more efficient by skipping an extra copy (we're already pretty fast though...)
  memcpy? 
    faster memcpy? loop?
  ideal: dual-threaded, and when it comes by you say "ok, use this copy already prepared" LOL
    test speed of from DESKTOP versus HWND. (possibly add to Bitblt [?])
    
== other ==
 do I need to have several "copies" of it installed, so you can capture while you view or what not?
 It probably needs to send out input "only if it's changed" I'm thinkin..." for my purposes anyway...
 shearing (?) compared to itself upscreened...
 the "drag to select window" seter-zy-upperzy
