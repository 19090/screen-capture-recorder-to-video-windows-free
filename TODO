dropdowns for selecting an audio [?]
  find a good default encoding with high fps or the like
  add encodings dropdown
    options "encode with this, then really encode using that"
  maybe fps :P

include the audio grabber too
  or complain/warn if they "should" have installed it already :)
  
can include audio
  can do just audio

can do "start", "stop" with audio + video
  just audio
    note it in the other project

can use hwnd.
  re-check stats when using versus not.
  does this work when thence dragged too...?

do we/should we re-encode after the capture?
  what's the second best [available] for capture after huffyuv?
  check mjpeg, mpeg4 video, others mentioned
  maybe there are slightly lossy ones that work well?
  x264 low compression or what not? high speed x264?

speedup:
  it should only advertise its screen bit depth [?] [blacky still slow...]
  then if necessary
  custom header + memcpy or straight memcpy if possible
    @audio "here's how to have both:" plus instructions from http://camstudio.org/forum/discussion/33/waveoutgetselectcontrol-failed/p2

new icon "display current settings"

easy streamer with VLC [?] ffmpeg?
  check for local firewall...
  uPnP ?
  looks like VLC for now until ffmpeg has qtcapture et al

more detailed instructions on "how to capture audio" for XP

bounty audio mixer ffmpeg, offer to help :P

qtcapture audio bounty VLC:P

a "test via snapshot" method

after window it should say what stats were set to.

there's a bug in released version windower

== maybe ==

ps3ms integration [with XBMC to test it [?]]
  tell them to use ffmpeg :P
  tell them they can become a playon.tv competitor!
  tell them to support wii browsing/playback :P

slider for audio/video quality

split pins up so that, in essence, the incoming guy can select his fps on the fly.
  if this is the only way, if this is "how" ffmpeg and VLC would use it to choose the right pin.
  I assume other properties are unsettable, basically, or something?

detect slow aero, tell them how to fix it :)

release "just the device" as an installable, or maybe just tell people they can use it/leverage it...

internally it can "stretch" or "downstretch" [except ffmpeg can just do that so...no big win there but hey :P]
  could save a bit of cpu time if we could capture that way, or do it earlier rather than later.
  just do naive sampling for now [?] maybe use some stretch function?
    +- optimized stretching [my own naive local]
    if they want non-naive then let them do that downstream
  "high quality scaling"

a way to "ignore" duplicates...
  doing this earlier could save some other [memcpy's] and processing time...

ideas from camstudio
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDiGO0clUY4
  etc. etc.

@ffmpeg: suggest tcmalloc (linux/windows?)

it can "draw" all over the main monitor on the fly optionally when recording.

it can pause to control start time more precisely...
  or at least have some output so they can tell when it really begins
  little green arrow/indicator for when ffmpeg actually has started for sure maybe?

it can have caption lists.

it can "re-encode" to something friendlier [x264?]

it can "remaster" videos by recording over them [?] to add captions et al?
  or maybe at least um...some way to add captions post fact...hmmm...

it should display 30 pins, one for each fps  :P
  maybe some for 0.5 fps too?
  convenient to save cpu in certain situations, slightly more cross program-zy ease
  at least I think ffmpeg would use this, possibly vlc too?

make so it can stream, too :P
  plus just audio

bounty lagarith ffmpeg [?]
  bounty windows codecs ffmpeg [?] libavcodec?

super spiffy "jruby.exe" installer, if that's faster at all
  splash screen?

can show mouse

can show arbitrary mouse [transparent?]

can follow mouse

can make mouse yellow

can make mouse yellow "sometimes"

@camstudio: the transparent fella is suh-weet.

log stats to the registry on exit... [+ jruby can read them to display...]

audio: instructions "just use your mic" or "pipe a bit of your mic back through line in, and use line in/virtual-audio-capturer"
  or allow it to have several channels for now...sure :P
    and eventually umm...fix ffmpeg to allow for it?

remember directory
  use a cooler looking file selector
  
auto-minimize to tray, stop on unminimize
  tell CamStudio

can include two audio, separate tracks

can do audio mixed

actually use it. playon competitor? LOL
  auto skype/google+ recorder :)
  can use the default record device in...XP

warn them if they appear slow...

== speedup ==

  it defaults to 24 bits [maybe wrongly?]

  can I live with aero wasn't bitblt getting like 800fps *with* aero?
  threading the input [?] (a bit complicated because of the "only if it's changed" mantra)
    more efficient by skipping an extra copy (we're already pretty fast though...)
  memcpy? 
    faster memcpy? loop?
  ideal: dual-threaded, and when it comes by you say "ok, use this copy already prepared" LOL
    test speed of from DESKTOP versus HWND. (possibly add to Bitblt [?])

== other ==
 rename "like camstudio" or the like/propaganda

 shearing (?) compared to itself upscreened...

== never ==
can i use camstudio's captions adder?
  that one online one?
