"sensible defaults" (just mine uh guess)

the "set them up elsewise" -> prompt "do you want to set them up" that works LOL.
  and should come right after selecting video dropdown...

mouse scaling is broken with "auto-scaling". Which makes sense.

can select video codec (any?) then muxer
  huffyuv vs. qtrle?
  "1080p" x264 presets, since they degrade nicely and *everybody* 
   -vcodec libx264 -s hd720 -preset ultrafast
    just output sizes I guess, for this one...

the README is *way* too verbose.

"recorded to" only after they've *recorded* something...
  also there's a V in there.
  "recorded to: 20.mp3, from: screen-capture-recorder"

== maybe ==

"input sizes" prompt (if/once ffmpeg supports pix_fmt, them too)

de-dupe: uses crc32 or something *faster* (adler, murmurhash) :P

real web page

compare all video codecs for movies, screencast somehow LOL.

virtualdub has wrong/messed up fps? huh?

== never ==

include option "window within a window?" then tell them to ask me to implement it LOL

compare ffmpeg -s hd720 to my own local rescaling of the thing...

make i420 come from 16 bit for added speed LOL.

fix ffmpeg doesn't have optimized yuv420p to rgb24 (bounty)

fix "stop after timing" button stuff, probably just do it local.

"stream to destination" LOL

saving to a slow disk I don't think it can keep up, audio gets messed?
  also does audio get out of sync?
  fix all these LOL

determine if getDIBIts gives you them in "bmp 0x003" format [to i420 method?]
  check if i420 works on divisible by 2, but not 4.  And doesn't cause a diagonal line :P

include avisynth, and its one demo script LOL.

test vcam/pushsource with expression encoder, fresh install? vm?

can capture several video incoming streams, too, in case you want to capture webcam (as a separate video stream whoa!)

make jruby startup faster LOL

repro "tearing", repro CAPTUREBLT helping, ask msdn

only download/install MSVCRT if absent.

@VLC "make it more reliable for streaming asynchronous non standard incoming stuff, plz?"

figure out how to start ffmpeg "instantaneously" or "restart it" or something, anything, to speedup start time yikes. (make it smaller?)

check if uscreencapture uses some direct3d funky capture fella
  is direct3d funky even faster? huh? is this just for games? I can't imagine it working for XP...

I may "need" to do some phreaky d3d screen capture to get it be fast enough with aero windows 8.  Hope not though. (I hope it lets me capture more quickly...)

LODO can I somehow BitBlt into the graphics card to save speed somehow? Or negotiate it so that pData points straight into the gpu?

check if libswscale would be "faster" than using windows' own resizing methods. Yikes if it is LOL.

multi thread so that it can do BitBlt while "the other one" is doing memcpy etc. LOL

advertise mine on google results for "stream desktop to tv" LOL

test in google plus

fix the tearing/shearing bug?
  just log the emails I saw on it
  that one "famous email" and then one other saw it...
  ask them why CAPTUREBLT might help...

better...reg names [explicit, with default]
TODO: beat 15 fps in windows 7/8/ask about it msdn etc. too

use dibsection+-memcpy? might need "funky" line stuff...hmm...does it though? what is going on there? (+ 31)/32 but I don't seem to experience failures with i420? or do I?
use drawdibdraw for speed?

skype hack so it will show in the preview LOL.

"follow mouse" option LOL

"yellow circle around mouse" option LOL

increase priority when capturing?
  optionally?

try "setting time for one frame in the future"
  seemed to fail
  
  or figure out if I can even get better than 15 fps at all.
  
don't use getDIBits [raw memcpy?] if we already match the right stuff. Oh wait getDIBits is probably already optimized for this case so we might not gain
anything, plus, this is a teeny overhead, compared to aero at least.

ask what I should *really* do waiting-wise here...

install 64 bit-ter with 32 always...sure :P

scale with DirectX. Not. LOL.

catch hard crash when writing to the reg

some super dumb-easy way to record the screen.
  "resize this window, and go!" with ability to stop--basically for recording films, etc.

16 bit javaw.exe doesn't seem "present" for 64 bit machines. what? nor java.exe?

can "smart poll" to know when it should switch to/grab the next frame [yeah right]
  like sample subsections to look for change LOL
  1/3rd the time, up front dedup [I guess this is the most efficient place to look for dupe's...]
    except it doesn't cost much so why not...100 fps? or poll [prolly not]?
  also why...does it seem to drag like that when upscaling? Is upconverting maxing out a core?
  
start green overlay flashing when ffmpeg actually starts LOL
  plus "start pause" synchro LOL.

prompt for filename "after"
  make audio "device only" ?
    new icon "record audio only" ?
	
@ffmpeg can you capture realtime?
  maybe pipe through avisynth and it can for now?
    also for audio as a work around for now...hmm...

nextsprocket my citrix competitor LOL, no good.
 though shared virtualbox boxes might work just as well...
 on online.net
    I don't know if I could ever compete. bad idea.

can ffmpeg be forced to "drop all them other frames, just chose the latest"? to keep up? does it keep up?

force them to have java installed first :P
delete storage file on uninstall

"issues"

qtrle ?

fix sound crackling <sniff>

easy streamer setter-upper with VLC [?] ffmpeg?
  ask if you want to beep after it's done...
  tell how to setup record what you hear, if initial fails (instructions)
  rename record what you hear.
  @VLC doesn't play itself
   huh? figure out?
  ping instructions
  looks like VLC for now until ffmpeg has qtcapture et al...
    hmm mac is somewhat of an enigma...
  uPnP ?
    never

  find a good default encoding with high video fps or the like
    qtrle
      16 bit?
  add encodings dropdown
    options "encode with this, then really encode using that"

dropdowns for selecting an audio side by side the video
  @audio "here's how to have both:" plus instructions from http://camstudio.org/forum/discussion/33/waveoutgetselectcontrol-failed/p2

can do "start", "stop" with audio + video
  just audio
    note it in the other project

can use hwnd dorectly.
  double check stats when using versus not.
  should work when dragged too...?

do we/should we re-encode after the capture?
  what's the second best [available] for capture after huffyuv?
  check mjpeg, mpeg4 video, others mentioned
  maybe there are slightly lossy ones that work well?
  x264 low compression or what not? high speed x264?

bounty ffserver windows [?]

a "test via snapshot" method

add a "start infinite mirror" helper app :P

it should default to 24 bit I guess, always

== maybe/never ==
@TODO: screen capture needs a real "window"
@TODO: screen capture: provide a demo VLC streaming example command line and/or saving it to disk

@TODO: when they hold down "x" it highlights the mouse
@TODO: it can follow the mouse, too

benchmark full screen speed, too.

use sox to combine audio [?]

bounty audio mixer ffmpeg, offer to help :P
  
try out red5 :P

  do I "need" a BI_BITFIELDS even? make it optional? 32-bit?
  
  system tray "start" "stop"
  prompt for filename after

"reset all" option

ask why ffmpeg -f dshow -i video=...:audio= stutters
  fix it
  
bounty camstudio encoding codec ffmpeg
  gzip

create the "amazing morpher/sweet broadcasting dshow input"
  it can have checkmarks for "on/off" of one way, I guess.
  AviSynth input, with ffmpeg input into that LOL.

https://github.com/Kovensky/mplayer-kovensky.git 

Another way is to directly manipulate the desktop bitmap in the Video Memory if enough memory is available as provided by DirectDraw.  http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/DesktopCaptureWithMouse.aspx hmm

  [blacky check if memcpy would be useful...]
    check on compression sizes

integrate with a mirror display driver, and somehow...have a codec that just describes diffs, I guess? That's the VNC codec in a pinch LOL.

a "wait until this bit is flipped to start" option :P

ps3ms integration [with XBMC to test it [?]]
  tell them to use ffmpeg :P
  tell them they can become a playon.tv competitor!
  tell them to support wii browsing/playback :P

slider for audio/video quality

split pins up so that, in essence, the incoming guy can select his fps on the fly.
  if this is the only way, if this is "how" ffmpeg and VLC would use it to choose the right pin.
  I assume other properties are unsettable, basically, or something?

detect slow aero, tell them how to fix it :)

release "just the device" as an installable, or maybe just tell people they can use it/leverage it...

internally it can "stretch" or "downstretch" [except ffmpeg can just do that so...no big win there but hey :P]
  could save a bit of cpu time if we could capture that way, or do it earlier rather than later.
  just do naive sampling for now [?] maybe use some stretch function?
    +- optimized stretching [my own naive local]
    if they want non-naive then let them do that downstream
  "high quality scaling"

a way to "ignore" duplicates...
  doing this earlier could save some other [memcpy's] and processing time...

ideas from camstudio
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDiGO0clUY4
  etc. etc.

@ffmpeg: suggest tcmalloc (linux/windows?)

it can "draw" all over the main monitor on the fly optionally when recording.

it can pause to control start time more precisely...
  or at least have some output so they can tell when it really begins
  little green arrow/indicator for when ffmpeg actually has started for sure maybe?

it can have caption lists.

it can "post-re-encode" to something friendlier [x264?]

it can "remaster" videos by recording over them [?] to add captions et al?
  or maybe at least um...some way to add captions post fact...hmmm...

it should display 30 pins, one for each fps  :P
  maybe some for 0.5 fps too?
  convenient to save cpu in certain situations, slightly more cross program-zy ease
  at least I think ffmpeg would use this, possibly vlc too?

make so it can stream, too :P
  plus just audio streaming even...
