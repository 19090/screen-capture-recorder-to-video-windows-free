  add jruby
  bitblt test
log stats to the registry on exit... [jruby can read them]
can use hwnd.
  re-check stats
  make it able to grab from a window, and work when dragged too...

== speedup ==

  can I live with aero wasn't bitblt getting like 800fps *with* aero?
  threading the input [?] (a bit complicated because of the "only if it's changed" mantra)
    more efficient by skipping an extra copy (we're already pretty fast though...)
  memcpy? 
    faster memcpy? loop?
  ideal: dual-threaded, and when it comes by you say "ok, use this copy already prepared" LOL
    test speed of from DESKTOP versus HWND. (possibly add to Bitblt [?])
    
== other ==
 It probably needs to send out input "only if it's changed" I'm thinkin..." for my purposes anyway...
 shearing (?) compared to itself upscreened...
 the "drag to select window" seter-zy-upperzy
