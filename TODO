dropdowns for selecting an audio [?]
  find a good default encoding with high fps or the like
  add encodings dropdown
    options "encode with this, then really encode using that"
  maybe fps :P

am I using the right start end timestamps [?] 

include the audio grabber too
  or complain/warn if they "should" have installed it already :)
  
can include audio
  can do just audio

can do "start", "stop" with audio + video
  just audio
    note it in the other project

can use hwnd.
  re-check stats when using versus not.
  does this work when thence dragged too...?

do we/should we re-encode after the capture?
  what's the second best for this after huffy?
  check mjpeg, mpeg4
  maybe there are slightly lossy ones that work well?
  x264 low compression or what not? high speed x264?

it should set fps in source too
then if necessary
it should only advertise its screen bit depth [blacky] [?]
then if necessary
custom header + memcpy or straight memcpy if possible
  @audio "here's how to have both:" plus instructions from http://camstudio.org/forum/discussion/33/waveoutgetselectcontrol-failed/p2

== maybe ==

it can "draw" all over the main monitor on the fly when recording.

it can pause to control start time more precisely...
  or at least have some output so they can tell when it really begins

it can have caption lists.

it can "remaster" videos by recording over them [?] to add captions et al?
  or maybe at least um...some way to add captions post fact...hmmm...

it should display 30 pins, one for each fps  :P
  maybe some for 0.5 fps too?
  convenient to save cpu in certain situations, slightly more cross program-zy ease
  at least I think ffmpeg would use this, possibly vlc too?

make so it can stream, too :P
  plus just audio

bounty lagarith ffmpeg [?]
  bounty windows codecs ffmpeg [?] libavcodec?

offer them an option to "downsample" [through ffmpeg uh guess]

super spiffy "jruby.exe" installer, if that's faster at all
  splash screen?

can show mouse

can show arbitrary mouse [transparent?]

can follow mouse

can make mouse yellow

can make mouse yellow "sometimes"

can have some transparent overlays LOL

@camstudio: the transparent fella is suh-weet.

add README links (2)

advertise "this includes a directshow device blah blah blah" betterlogic

log stats to the registry on exit... [+ jruby can read them to display...]

can "force only next frame" ness? might not need this...
  skip_frame_if_same_as_previous option :P yes

audio: instructions "just use your mic" or "pipe a bit of your mic back through line in, and use line in/virtual-audio-capturer"
  or allow it to have several channels for now...sure :P
    and eventually umm...fix ffmpeg to allow for it?

remember directory
  use a cooler looking file selector
  
GradientTranslucentWindow

auto-minimize to tray, stop on unminimize
  tell CamStudio

bring back the "window drawer" but work LOL

can include two audio, separate tracks

can do audio mixed

actually use it. playon competitor? LOL
  auto skype recorder :)
  can use the default record device in...XP

can "record" not just play from desktop or vice versa
  oh and stream LOL
  
gstreamer for streaming?
  ruby?

warn them if they appear slow...

== speedup ==

  it defaults to 24 bits [maybe wrongly?]

  can I live with aero wasn't bitblt getting like 800fps *with* aero?
  threading the input [?] (a bit complicated because of the "only if it's changed" mantra)
    more efficient by skipping an extra copy (we're already pretty fast though...)
  memcpy? 
    faster memcpy? loop?
  ideal: dual-threaded, and when it comes by you say "ok, use this copy already prepared" LOL
    test speed of from DESKTOP versus HWND. (possibly add to Bitblt [?])
    
== other ==
rename "like camstudio" or the like/propaganda

 do I need to have several "copies" of it installed, so you can capture while you view or what not?
 It probably needs to send out input "only if it's changed" I'm thinkin..." for my purposes anyway...
 shearing (?) compared to itself upscreened...
 the "drag to select window" seter-zy-upperzy

== never ==
can i use camstudio's captions adder?
  that one online one?
