Basically this aims to be a free, quality, general purpose, open source directshow screen capture filter.
I couldn't find any so made my own :)

It is gently lifted from ("inspired by?")
  ...\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Samples\multimedia\directshow\filters\pushsource as well as some others.
  so you'll probably want to install the SDK before messing around in this code.

Message me if interested in using it, or with any feature requests :)

== installation ==

To install, run regsvr32 source_code/Release/PushSource.dll
  You'll need to run it as administrator if on vista/7.
To uninstall, run regsvr32 /u source_code/Release/PushSource.dll

== configuration ==
By default, it captures "full screen" of the main monitor.

To configure it, adjust these registry settings:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\os_screen_capture
with DWORD keys respected of:
  start_x, start_y, width, height
  # unimplemented, but will if there is ever any request/demand for them:
  # monitor_number, fps, hwnd_to_use, show_mouse
  
ex: see incoming.reg (though NB that those values are in hex, so editing that file is a bit tedious).  
Run also the jruby setup script in configuration_setup_utility for one way to set them up.

If no registry settings are set, it defaults to full screen.  If any value is set to 0, that means "not set" so it uses defaults.

Basically its purpose is for screen capture.

== trouble shooting ==

it's too slow:
turn off aero display manager (esp. if you have dual monitors, this may help).
try switching from 16 to 32 bit (within BltTest there is  troubleshooting_benchmarker\BltTest\Release\BltTest.exe run it to see which is faster)
  What you care about is the "reverse" speed.

== Future work ==
I can add feature upon demand.
I could add a "push bitmap" as a new additional filter, if ever desired.

I could make this into a real bonafide "directshow input capture" source (pseudo-camera) if desired, as well, though some
other products out there also do that and are free for private use, but I could if desired (ping me).
Basically you want a feature, ping me, you got it.

blttest is originally from http://stereopsis.com/blttest and measure bitblt speed 
(which is quite hardware dependent, or so I'm told).
