Basically there seem to be no quality, general purpose, free open source directshow screen capture filters out there, 
so this pretends to be the first.

It is gently lifted from ("inspired by?")
  Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Samples\multimedia\directshow\filters\pushsource
  so you'll probably want to install those before messing around in the code.

Message me if interested in learning or using it, or with any feature requests :)

To install, run regsvr32 on PushSource.dll

To configure it's:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\os_screen_capture
with DWORD keys:
  start_x, start_y, width, height
  # unimplemented, but will if there is ever any request/demand for them:
  # monitor_number, fps, hwnd_to_use, show_mouse
  
see incoming.reg (though NB that those values are in hex, so editing that file is a bit hard).  

If none are set, it defaults to full screen.  If any value is set to 0, that means "not set" so it defaults to the default.

For ease of configuration, there is a jruby script in easy_setup directory to help configure them.
