Basically this aims to be a free, quality, general purpose, open source directshow desktop screen source capture filter.
I couldn't find any so made my own :)

I.e. it allows you to "record" your desktop into your (directshow compatible) device.

It is gently lifted from ("inspired by")
  ....\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Samples\multimedia\directshow\filters\pushsource as well as some other dshow demos around.
  so you'll probably want to install the SDK before messing around with this code.

Message me if interested in it, or with any feature requests :)
It's free and open source.

== installation ==

To install, run $ regsvr32 source_code\Release\PushDesktop.ax
  You'll need to run it as administrator if on vista/7.
  
To uninstall it, run $ regsvr32 /u source_code\Release\PushDesktop.ax

Ping me if you want this automated or can't get it to work.

== configuration ==

By default, it captures "full screen" of the main desktop monitor.

To configure, adjust these registry settings:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\os_screen_capture
with DWORD keys respected of:
  start_x, start_y, width, height
  # unimplemented, but will be if there is ever any request for them:
  # monitor_number, fps, hwnd_to_use, show_mouse
  
ex: see incoming.reg (though NB that those values are in hex, so editing that file is a bit tedious).  

The jruby setup script in configuration_setup_utility is another way to set them up.
If any value registry value is set to 0, that means "not set" so it uses the default for that value.


== trouble shooting ==

it's too slow:
turn off aero display manager (esp. if you have dual monitors, this may help).
disabling/enabling "hardware acceleration" for your desktop might help, too.
try switching from 16 to 32 bit 
Within BltTest there is  troubleshooting_benchmarker\BltTest\Release\BltTest.exe file.
Run it to benchmark your system and compare the various settings.
  What you care about is the "reverse" timing speed in its output display.

Other things ping me rogerdpack@gmail.com or mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/roger-projects

== Future work ==

I can add features upon demand.

I could make this into a real bonafide "directshow input capture" source (pseudo-camera) if desired, as well, though some
other products out there also do that and are free for private use, but I could if desired (ping me).
Basically you want a feature, ping me, you got it.
