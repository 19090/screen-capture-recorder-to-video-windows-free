This is gently lifted from

Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Samples\multimedia\directshow\filters\pushsource

Basically there seem to be no quality, general purpose, free open source directshow screen capture filters out there, so this is the first.

Message me if interested in learning or using it, or feature requests :)

To configure it's:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\os_screen_capture
with DWORD keys:
  start_x, start_y, width, height, monitor_number, fps, hwnd_to_use
  
see incoming.reg (though NB that those values are in hex...)
