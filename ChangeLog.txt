0.2.2:
  make it respond more accurately to GetStreamCaps, for enumeration to work (ffmpeg better at least) and it appears to work better with gstreamer as well.
  minor UI tweaks

0.2.1:
  make it easier to re-register on failed etc.

0.2.0: 
  Even better window drawer (now transparent with java 7)
  slightly optimized screen capture (optimized to not use CPU currently, creates huges files though!)
  it still uses too much cpu, but working on it.
  default to 24 fps (hmm)

0.1.1: Better window drawer (kind of)

0.1.0: has a friendlier script for recording screen, another option for setting it up

0.0.4: Include more executables, including the option to record now [!]

0.0.2: better name, report "better" stats to the capture device.

0.0.3: respects fps settings, in its own kludgey way.  Should work though, and not cause any slowdown if you can't keep up anyway :)
