 wired might work better... :P

notes:
 1024x1024:
   15% one cpu used by the capture utility (0.013ms per capture)
   good for now I guess (no transparency visible...)
   12 fps <sigh>

VBLE in my anime encoding .... the normal size for my huffyuv avi for the show was 5-6 gigs and with vble i got 4.4 gig
  appears abandoned

1680x1050 was 20 MB/s huffyuv

utvideo is the "best" lossless they say...http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Ut_Video_Codec_Suite
  or is that just for playback though?
  
MSU lossless codec is abandoned and not developed nor supported anymore. It was never even close to realtime
Xvid with search options at 0, no B frames, and constant quality 1 or 2 is very fast, even with one core. You can specify it use just intra (I) frames, but it wouldn't be slow decoding with P-frames.
imho, Fastest visually lossless codec is Cineform wavelet :) [not free]
   Cineform isn't in this test. It's not cheap, but it DOES let you capture 10 bit 4:2:2 1080p24 in real time to a single drive
ArithYUV 
YLC (YUY2 Lossless Codec version 0.25


Lagarith clearly beats relatively fast codecs both by compression ratio and fps. http://compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/pdf/msu_lossless_codecs_comparison_2007_eng.pdf

HUFFYUV did 34fps
Uncompressed did 24fps
Aware Wavelet did 48fps

CorePNG

check camstudio?

maybe ask the lagarith guy to port it?
