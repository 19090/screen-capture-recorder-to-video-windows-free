0.1.1: Better window drawer (kind of)

0.1.0: has a friendlier script for recording screen, another option for setting it up

0.0.4: Include more executables, including the option to record now [!]

0.0.2: better name, report "better" stats to the capture device.

0.0.3: respects fps settings, in its own kludgey way.  Should work though, and not cause any slowdown if you can't keep up anyway :)
